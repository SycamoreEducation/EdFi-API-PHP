EdFi-PHP-API Wrapper
==============

A PHP wrapper for the EdFi API as implemented by the Wisonsin Department of Public Instruction (DPI).

Please see these links for additional resources on Wisconsin's requirements:

- [DPI Ed-Fi Integration](http://dpi.wi.gov/wisedata/ed-fi-integration)
- [JSON Resource Mapping for Wisconsin DPI](http://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/wisedata/pdf/WISEdata_Ed-Fi_Integration.pdf)
- [Swagger Interactive API Documentation](https://uawisedataapi.dpi.wi.gov/EdFiSwagger/)
- [Wonderful HTTP Requester Add-on for Firefox](https://github.com/tommut/HttpRequester)

This is still under heavy development and is not recommended for production use. Many methods are missing as this is just scaffolding for now.

Please see the example index page for details on how to use this library.
